# What It's Worth
A calculator to help visualize how many hours it would take to pay for something.  
Developed on the side during my Farmingdale Swift development course (I forget the course number).

I hope to build on this project, but I'm focusing on game development for now.
I intend to finish and sell it as a final product in the future.
To that end this project will remain unlicensed.
